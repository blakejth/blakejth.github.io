          <p>Now that I was in the swing of things, I could review the topics and see what needed to be done. These were the 14 topics that we were assigned to learn. Java Collections, JUnit Tests, Threads, Executors, and Runnables, System Level Tests, Use Case Diagrams, Use Case Documents, Application Controller Pattern, MVC, Hibernate, State Diagrams, Sequence Diagrams, QCJSON and JSON, Android HttpUrlConnection, Servlets.</p>

          <p>In the interest of time I won’t be going over everything single thing I have learned over the past 14 weeks but I will talk about a few key principles that I learned and their impact on my professional and personal life.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Servlets</h2>

          <p>Servlets was a topic that I really took a liking to. I am a big fan of web development and it is always fun to see classes tied together. I can use information and knowledge from CIT 230 to help demonstrate a higher learning. Not only can I show what I have learned in the Java language, I can also show mastery over basic HTML and front end development. It is also amazing to see how the java language interacts with the website and servlets is a good example of how multiple languages come together.</p>

          <h3>Advantages of a Java Servlet</h3>

          <p>Servlet is faster than CGI as it doesn’t involve the creation of a new process for every new request received.</p>

          <p>Servlets as written in Java are platform independent.</p>

          <p>Removes the overhead of creating a new process for each request as Servlet doesn’t run in a separate process. There is only a single instance which handles all requests concurrently. This also saves the memory and allows a Servlet to easily manage client state.</p>

          <p>It is a server-side component, so Servlet inherits the security provided by the Web server.</p>

          <p>The API designed for Java Servlet automatically acquires the advantages of Java platform such as platform independent and portability. In addition, it obviously can use the wide range of APIs created on Java platform such as JDBC to access the database.</p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-java-servlets/</blockquote>

          <p>This website contains great basic knowledge on servlets and how to get started. It is a guide I used while creating my own program. Here is what I created for my own program. It is simple but meets the requirements!</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">MVC – My favorite so far</h2>

          <p>I started to learn about MVC during week 4 which I know is late but things came up and it pushed me. The reason why I really enjoyed MVC is because the concept clicked at the very beginning. The idea of having a program with a “program” between the data and the client view makes so much sense to me. It also adds another layer of protection for both client and data. </p>

          <p>Even though this was my favorite topic so far, I did run into an issue since I created a program had the model, view and controller all in the same program and while it demonstrated understanding of the topics principle, it missed an important aspect of MVC which requires all parts to be seperated.</p>

          <p>I really enjoyed this topic and the links to my prestation can be found <a href="https://github.com/blakejth/CIT360/blob/master/Assignments/MVC/MVC%20Presentation.pdf">here</a>.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Teamwork makes the dream work!</h2>

          <a href="#">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="https://www.beefmagazine.com/sites/beefmagazine.com/files/styles/article_featured_retina/public/mgmt-matters-teamwork-katleho-Seisa-GettyImages.jpg?itok=jxeXqMiO" alt="Teamwork">
          </a>

          <p>through out this class I did struggle and I am sure that I am not alone in that. There were many different topics that came up that were confusing and didn't click. I credit a lot of my success to my group because they were there (the ones who didn't drop out) to help me and not just with the assigned presentation. There were many that I reached out to personally and asked for assistance. Hibernate really confused me and didn't make a lot of sense but with the help of my team I was able to get basic.</p>

          <p>This might also be a side note but, since this is my last class the way the grade looks every week scares me! I looked over my past journal entries for this class and this is something that came up a lot. I still am just hoping that everything works out in the end.</p>
