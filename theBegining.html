          <p>Let me start out by saying that I have taken this class before but I didn't pass because of what was going on around and because of the dificulty of the class itself. This is (hopefully) my last sememster so the pressure was on to keep up with the class.</p>

          <p>When the class first started, I found myself eager to get a head start. I have taken this class before so it should theoretically give me an advantage. I believe that it was the start of the second week that we finally got into our groups and we could begin working on our schedule. Me and another student were communicating in the wrong place, so I already started off on the wrong foot and I was late to our first group meeting. </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">The First Meeting</h2>

          <p>This meeting was all about getting to know each other and getting the schedule together in accordance with the assignment:</p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">“Come up with a group plan to reach a fluency level of 'Basic' for the topics listed below. Fill in this excel document with your personal and group schedulePreview the document. Indicate the following in your plans: Which topics you and your group will learn that week and who will be teaching them.”</blockquote>

          <p>While there was a lot of discussion about everyone’s lives and expectations for the class, we finally got into the groove of things for the meeting and started to divvy out the assignments and came up with the following:</p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/thePlan.jpg" alt="TeamSchedule">

          <h2 class="section-heading">Even more planning</h2>

          <p>Since I had been through this before, I knew that planning was key and decided to upgrade that schedule and create the best one I could and attach it on my wall. This is what I came up with:</p>

          <div class="well text-center">
            <span>The three month plan:</span>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <a href="#"><img src="img/septemberPlan.jpg" alt="September Plan" /></a>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <a href="#" ><img src="img/octoberPlan.jpg" alt="October Plan" /></a>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <a href="#" ><img src="img/novemberPlan.jpg" alt="November Plan" /></a>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2>Post meeting</h2>

          <p>It was a great meeting and we all left feeling like we would conquer the class with flying colors. The schedule had been set to learn the 14 topics and to continue on with our professional and academic lives. If only it was that easy.</p>

          <p>“Alot of people are all talk, what they say and what they do are two different things. As the saying goes, talk is cheap. Without actions behind the talk, it is all useless.” (Catherine Pulsifer)</p>
