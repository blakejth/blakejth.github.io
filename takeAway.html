          <p>After reviewing my notes, I know that I have grown so much in this class and I know that the impact and knowledge is something that I will take with me forever.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Teamwork</h2>

          <p>I touched on this a little bit in my other post about the bulk of the class but I wanted to touch base again about the impact that others have on our lives and possible benefit of those around us. In a way, we are all on a team and we all have somewhat common goals. The light of Christ really helps us come together in love and unity and care for those around us.</p>

          <p>I learned in this class and classes in the past that everyone has a different perspective and a different background to help us learn and grow. Knowledge, in this ever increasingly advanced society is based on our ability to ask and receive information from those around us. We go to church and often hear the same things over and over but that is because of our mental limits in knowledge and memory retention. We should never be afraid to ask those around us for help. In a way, asking for help is a way of helping others as well because it is common knowledge that the more you talk about something the easier it becomes to remember. When teaching, we often find ourselves remembering more down the line because of the repetition.</p>

          <p>My team helped me time and time again with topics I struggled with. They took time out of their day to make sure that I was at least in a place where I could get basic.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Laziness and procrastination</h2>

          <p>This is a topic that I have struggled with my entire life and more so in my academic life. Looking over my past entries, I can see exactly where procrastination hits and it is almost sad! I really believe in a balance in our lives between hard work and mental health and procrastination is what can break the scale. The feeling of being overwhelmed can be defeated with good planning but action is stronger than words. Even starting out with a great group and a well planned out sememster, I found myself at the mercy of time. As work began to pile, so did my nerves.</p>

          <p>There is a point at which I reach that turn on the back burners and I blaze through my work. While it is good to get the work done, this often means that I have less time to dedicate to the things that matter and those around me. I can also see that there is a gradual decline in my mental and physical health. I stay up late, eat fast food for conveience and I don't go on dates with my wife.</p>

          <p>I do understand that work is a little different because you can leave it for the next day when its time to go home. The main takeaway here for me is that projects and work assignments can pile as well. Balance is needed to be a good employee and I will work hard to keep that balance.</p>
